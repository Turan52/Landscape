Normal user - no root
(if you had SSL error)
scp root@XXX.XXX.XX.XXX:/etc/ssl/certs/landscape_server_ca.crt (installing SSL certificate)
sudo chown root:root landscape_server_ca.crt (changing ownership of the certificate file)
sudo mv landscape_server_ca.crt /etc/landscape

We need to add SSL certificate destination into .conf file

sudo nano /etc/landscape/client.conf  
Adding these lines: ssl_public_key = /etc/landscape/landscape_server_ca.crt
